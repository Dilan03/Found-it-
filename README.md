Developing this project presented several challenges, particularly because it was born out of the need to solve a common problem at our university. Designing the database and establishing the relationships between different pieces of information proved to be one of the most difficult aspects. Ensuring that the data structure could efficiently handle user posts, search queries, and the interactions between users required careful planning and iteration.
